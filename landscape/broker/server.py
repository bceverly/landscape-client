"""
The C{BrokerServer} bridges client side plugins to the C{MessageExchange}.
It provides then with a mechanism to send messages to the server and, likewise,
triggers those plugins to take action when a exchange is impending or
resynchronisaton is required.

Each client plugin has to be registered using the
L{BrokerServer.register_client} method, after which two way communications is
possible between the C{BrokerServer} and the client.

Resynchronisation Sequence
==========================


 (See L{landscape.broker.exchange} sequence diagram for origin of the
 "resynchronize-clients" event).

 1. [event 1]               --->  BrokerServer        : Event
                                                      : "resynchronize-clients"

 2. [event 2]               <---  BrokerServer        : Broadcast event
                                                      : "resynchronize"

 3. [optional: various C{BrowserClientPlugin}s respond
               to the "resynchronize" event to reset
               themselves and start report afresh.]
     (See: L{landscape.monitor.packagemonitor.PackageMonitor}
           L{landscape.monitor.plugin.MonitorPlugin}
           L{landscape.manager.keystonetoken.KeystoneToken}
           L{landscape.monitor.activeprocessinfo.ActiveProcessInfo} )


 4. [event 1]               ---> MessageExchange      : Event
    (NOTE, this is the same event as step 1.)         : "resynchronize-clients"

 5. MessageExchange         ---> MessageExchange      : Schedule urgent
                                                      : exchange
